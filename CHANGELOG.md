## [2.6.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Auto-updater** (`nyx update check/install/rollback/channel`) — GitHub
  Releases API integration with SHA-256 integrity verification, rollback
  support, and non-blocking startup version notification after unlock
- **Named vault profiles** (`nyx vault profiles/use/add-profile/remove-profile`)
  — multiple vaults managed from one installation; active profile auto-resolves
  vault path across all commands
- **JSON output mode** (`nyx --json`) — any command emits machine-readable JSON;
  supported on secret get/list/search, vault status, generate password/passphrase
- **TOTP per entry** — store a TOTP secret alongside credentials;
  `nyx secret totp [entry]` shows live 6-digit code with countdown bar;
  `--watch` flag auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- **Vault health score** (`nyx security health`) — 0–100 composite grade
  across strength, breach-free, no-reuse, age, and TOTP coverage
- **Rotation reminders** (`nyx security due [--days N]`) — lists entries
  whose password hasn't changed in N days, sorted oldest-first
- **nyx vault import** — extended with `--totp-secret` on update command
- **Scripting layer** — `nyx script pipe`, `nyx script run`, `nyx script fzf`
  for credential injection into subprocesses without shell history exposure
- **Python SDK** (`from nyxora import VaultClient`) — high-level programmatic
  vault access with context manager, session-based and password-based modes
- **Textual TUI** (`nyx tui`) — Obsidian Tactical interactive vault browser;
  entry list with j/k navigation, live search overlay, detail panel with
  TOTP countdown, audit dashboard, amber #C89A30 tactical theme
- **Shell completions v2** — entry titles complete live from vault on Tab
  for `nyx secret get`, `nyx secret update`, `nyx secret delete`
- **PyInstaller build** — Windows standalone `nyx.exe` with gem icon;
  `python scripts_build/build_windows.py` produces a single-file executable

### Security
- Schema version bumped to "2"; silent migration adds `totp_secret_enc` column
  to existing v2.0.0 vaults on first open — HMAC stays consistent

### Breaking Changes
- None — fully backward-compatible with v2.0.0 vault files

---

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- `nyx vault import` — batch import from CSV, Bitwarden JSON, 1Password CSV,
  and Nyxora JSON export formats with auto-detection and dry-run preview
- In-session entry cache on VaultStore — eliminates O(N) decryptions on
  repeated list/search operations; invalidated on every mutation
- `VaultStore.get_metadata_value()` — public API for metadata queries,
  replacing internal `_conn` access in the recovery status command
- `nyx generate password --min-strength` — regenerates up to 10 times until
  the requested entropy threshold (weak/fair/strong/excellent) is met
- `nyx generate passphrase --count/-n` — generate multiple passphrases in
  one call, matching the `password` command's existing `--count` flag
- `nyx secret update --tags` — replace tags on an existing entry
- `nyx secret add --custom` — attach arbitrary key=value custom fields
- Full EFF Large Wordlist (7,776 words) replaces the 204-word sample —
  5-word passphrase entropy: 37.7 bits → 64.6 bits
- 9 new terminal UI components: `entropy_bar`, `strength_badge`,
  `checklist_panel`, `danger_panel`, `session_dashboard`,
  `audit_summary_panel`, `clipboard_countdown`, `update_diff_panel`,
  `recovery_status_panel`
- Visual entropy bar and strength badge on all generation commands
- `nyx vault status` now shows a rich session dashboard (entries, session
  token prefix, inactivity timeout, failed attempt count, cipher suite)
- `nyx vault health-check` renders a pass/fail integrity checklist
- `nyx security audit` appends a colour-coded summary panel
- `nyx backup export --plaintext` requires a two-step danger confirmation
  (confirm prompt + type the word CONFIRM)
- `nyx secret get --copy` auto-clears clipboard after 30 seconds
- `nyx recovery status` now shows real TOTP/capsule/share detection
- Real integration tests replacing empty stubs: full vault lifecycle,
  brute-force lockout ladder, 3-layer tamper detection, entry cache,
  metadata API, and CSV import round-trip (135 tests total)

### Security
- Recovery capsule inner and outer encryption now use HKDF-derived
  independent keys (`nyxora:capsule:inner` / `nyxora:capsule:outer`) —
  previously both layers shared `capsule_key` directly
- Locker `.nyx` files now embed a 16-byte random salt in the header;
  identical filenames always produce a different encryption key
- `nyx secret update --password` flag removed — password no longer exposed
  in shell history or `ps aux`; interactive prompt required instead
- Plaintext backup export now requires double confirmation with exact word
  match to prevent accidental credential exposure

### Performance
- `wipe_memory()` passes 2 and 3 now use `ctypes.memset` — orders of
  magnitude faster for large buffers
- `gc.collect()` removed from `wipe_memory()` — eliminates ResourceWarning
  cascade and unnecessary GC pressure on every key wipe
- GF(256) multiplicative inverse is now an O(1) precomputed lookup table
  (was O(256) brute-force per call)
- `security audit` HIBP checks now run concurrently via
  `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)` — ~10× faster for large vaults

### Fixed
- `nyx vault change-password`: atomic three-step file swap with rollback —
  power loss can no longer permanently destroy the vault (Phase 1)
- HMAC comparisons in `_verify_entry_hmac` and `_verify_vault_hmac` now
  use `hmac.compare_digest()` — eliminates timing oracle (Phase 1)
- `SessionManager` brute-force ladder now active at CLI level —
  `record_failed_attempt()` and `record_successful_unlock()` wired in (Phase 1)
- `SessionManager._running` initialised in `__init__` — no more
  `AttributeError` when `lock()` called before `unlock()` (Phase 1)
- `delete_entry` now verifies entry HMAC before soft-deletion, consistent
  with `get_entry` and `update_entry` (Phase 1)
- `unlock --create` branch now writes the `.salt` file — vault can be
  re-opened after creation via `--create` flag (Phase 2)
- Empty tag list `[]` in `migrate_from_store` no longer treated as `None` —
  HMAC mismatch after migration fixed (Phase 2)
- `locker_key` always wiped in `finally` block during encrypt — key no
  longer leaked in memory on exception (Phase 2)
- `_derive_argon2id` removes pointless `tmp` wipe of a bytearray copy;
  `del raw` minimises lifetime of the immutable `bytes` object (Phase 2)
- Dead code removed: unreachable `return` after `raise` in HIBP check;
  unused `sha1` variable in `check_breach_offline` (Phase 4)
- `Config.validate()` called on every `load()` — invalid configs no longer
  silently propagate (Phase 4)
- `nyx recovery status` no longer returns placeholder text (Phase 2 UI)
- Panic exit code changed to 4 — no conflict with brute-force lockout
  exit code 3 (Phase 2 UI)

### Breaking Changes
- `.nyx` locker files created with v1.x are **not compatible** with v2.0.0.
  The file header format changed to include a 16-byte per-file salt.
  Re-encrypt files using `nyx locker decrypt` (v1.x) then
  `nyx locker encrypt` (v2.0.0).
- Recovery capsules created with v1.x are **not compatible** with v2.0.0.
  The HKDF key derivation for inner/outer layers changed.
  Recreate capsules using `nyx recovery create-capsule`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-03

### Performance
- `wipe_memory()` passes 2+3 use `ctypes.memset` (single C-level write)
- `gc.collect()` removed from `wipe_memory()` — fixes ResourceWarning flood
- GF(256) inverse now O(1) precomputed lookup table
- HIBP audit requests now concurrent via `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)`

### Security
- Recovery capsule: HKDF-separated inner/outer keys
- Locker: per-file 16-byte salt embedded in `.nyx` header
- Full EFF large wordlist (7,776 words) — fixes ~27-bit entropy overstatement

### Fixed
- Dead code removed from `intel_engine.py` (unreachable return, unused sha1)
- `strength_color()` removed from `generate.py` (replaced by `strength_badge`)
- `TYPE_CHECKING` no-op removed from `crypto_engine.py`
- `click` removed as explicit dep (transitive via `typer[all]`)
- `Config.validate()` now called on `load()`
- Inactivity monitor mock exhaustion warning resolved in test suite

### CI
- Matrix expanded: ubuntu + windows × Python 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 (6 jobs)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- 9 new UI components: entropy bar, strength badge, checklist panel,
  danger panel, session dashboard, audit summary panel, clipboard countdown,
  update diff panel, recovery status panel

  detection (7 tests replacing empty stubs)
- `nyx vault status` → rich session dashboard
- `nyx vault health-check` → integrity checklist panel
- `nyx security audit` → summary panel appended
- `nyx backup export --plaintext` → two-step danger confirmation
- `nyx secret get --copy` → 30-second clipboard auto-clear
- `nyx recovery status` → real TOTP/capsule/share detection

### Fixed
- `unlock --create` writes salt file (vault was uncloseable after creation)
- Empty tag list migration HMAC mismatch resolved
- `locker_key` wiped in `finally` on encrypt exception
- `_derive_argon2id` removes misleading `tmp` wipe
- `nyx secret update --password` flag removed (shell history exposure)
